# Zebrafish Blender Workflow

Working with zebrafish data with Nikolas Claussen's [Blender Tissue Cartography](https://github.com/nikolas-claussen/blender-tissue-cartography). Updates will be added.  

The main file of interest here should be `zebrafish_workthrough_01a.ipynb`
- NB: This is meant to be a read through notebook only! Some files that are used are too large to be uploaded to git so this may crash if you run it.
