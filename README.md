# Zebrafish Blender Workflow

Working with zebrafish data with Nikolas Claussen's [Blender Tissue Cartography](https://github.com/nikolas-claussen/blender-tissue-cartography). Updates will be added.  

The main files of interest here should be `zebrafish_workthrough_01a.ipynb` as well as `TP0_Ch0_Ill0_Ang0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315_16bit_DS_projected.tif` (pullbacks), `TP0_Ch0_Ill0_Ang0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315_16bit_DS_normals.tif` (normal vecotrs), and `TP0_Ch0_Ill0_Ang0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315_16bit_DS_3d_coordinates.tif` (embeddings).
- NB: The Jupyter Notebook is meant to be a read through notebook only! Some files that are used are too large to be uploaded to git so this may crash if you run it.
